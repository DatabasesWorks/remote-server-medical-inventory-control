# Preferences

Preferences are a junk drawer of misc settings and configurations for various levels of users. The preferences are partitioned into 4 groups:

- Server preference: Server specific settings and configuration options.
- Site preferences: These are settings and configuration options for an entire site.
- Store preferences: Settings and configuration options for a single store within a site.
- User preferences: A users settings and configuration options.

Preferences will be anything from the default tax percentage to the frequency in which the database will be backed up.
